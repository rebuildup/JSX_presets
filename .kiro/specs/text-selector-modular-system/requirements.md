# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Text Selector Modular System v2.0 is a comprehensive After Effects scripting solution designed to replace and enhance the existing Text_Selector.ffx preset. This system transforms a monolithic preset into a modular, maintainable, and extensible JSX script ecosystem that provides advanced text animation capabilities with improved performance and user experience optimized for modern Expression Engine.

The system enables motion graphics artists to create sophisticated text animations through a collection of interconnected modules that control timing, positioning, opacity, transformations, randomization, and wiggle effects. Each module operates independently while seamlessly communicating with others through Expression Controls, providing both flexibility and power. The enhanced version includes advanced error handling, performance optimizations, smooth wiggle capabilities, and comprehensive debugging tools.
